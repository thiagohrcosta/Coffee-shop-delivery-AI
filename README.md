Coffee Shop AI is a platform designed to simulate real-world scenarios by creating a virtual store integrated with Stripe for payment processing and utilizing artificial intelligence to enhance user interaction. The core feature of this application is a real-time Chatbot capable of interacting with various parts of the application. For instance, users can request the Chatbot to open a support ticket detailing their order, the conversation summary, and necessary actions to ensure that support staff has a clear understanding of the reported issue.

## Features

-   **Stripe Integration**: Securely handle payments with Stripe, allowing users to enter credit card details or other payment methods to complete their purchases.
-   **Real-Time Chatbot**: An AI-driven Chatbot that can interact with users and perform tasks such as opening support tickets and summarizing conversations.
-   **User Interaction**: Engage with the Chatbot to get assistance and manage orders effectively.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is not to develop a comprehensive virtual store but to integrate an external payment system and implement AI features to enhance user experience. This project demonstrates how to use Stripe for payment processing and OpenAI for AI functionalities. For more extensive virtual store development, you can explore other repositories where Ruby on Rails is used extensively, either for full-fledged e-commerce platforms or as a backend API for a React frontend.
